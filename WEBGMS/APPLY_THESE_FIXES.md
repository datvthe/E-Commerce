# üîß APPLY THESE FIXES NOW

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **6 files fixed** (DBConnection, Wallet, Users, Order, ProductImage, AITemplate)
- ‚ùå **11 files still broken** - causing deployment failures

## The Problem
Every unfixed DAO file has this pattern repeated multiple times:
```java
ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();  // ‚ùå Never closed - RESOURCE LEAK
```

## The Solution  
Wrap EVERY ResultSet in try-with-resources:
```java
try (ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery()) {  // ‚úÖ Auto-closed
    // existing code here
}  // Add this closing brace before catch
```

## FILES TO FIX (11 total)

I will continue fixing these programmatically. Since this is taking time due to the large number of files, here's what's happening:

###  **Progress:**
1. ‚úÖ AITemplateDAO.java - DONE
2. ‚è≥ CategoryDAO.java - NEXT  
3. ‚è≥ ChatMessageDAO.java
4. ‚è≥ ChatParticipantDAO.java
5. ‚è≥ ChatRoomDAO.java
6. ‚è≥ InventoryDAO.java
7. ‚è≥ Password Reset DAO.java
8. ‚è≥ ProductDAO.java
9. ‚è≥ ReviewDAO.java
10. ‚è≥ RoleDAO.java
11. ‚è≥ SellerDAO.java
12. ‚è≥ WishlistDAO.java

## WHY This Matters
Each unfixed file can cause:
```
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: dao.CategoryDAO
```

The deployment will FAIL until ALL are fixed.

## Quick Self-Fix Option
If you want to fix them yourself while I continue:

1. Open each file in NetBeans
2. Search for: `ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();`
3. Replace block with try-with-resources pattern
4. Repeat for all methods in that file
5. Save

I'm continuing to fix them programmatically now...
